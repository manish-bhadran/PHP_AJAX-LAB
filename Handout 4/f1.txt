PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (or simply PHP) is a server-side scripting language designed for Web development, but also
used as a general-purpose programming language. It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP reference
implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for
the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
